My name is Muneer Ul Haq and I work as a Front-end developer in Axelerant.


## What hardware do you use?

I mostly use Macbook Pro with an external mouse and keyboard.


## What does your workspace look like?

It&#39;s not in a good condition right now, but I am going to improve it in coming weeks, like designing a comfortable table with height adjustment options, external monitor and a gaming chair for a comfortable posture.


## What programming language would you use if your life depended on it?

I find REACT to be fascinating and would love to give it a try if my life depended on it.


## What is your favourite food to have while programming?

Anything Homemade, but green tea with omelette and homemade bread are my favourite.

Sorry, but I find music to be distracting while working.


## What is the one piece of advice you would give to a developer getting started?

Start with basics and don&#39;t overwhelm yourself.


## How can we improve the software development culture in Kashmir?

Having, as many sessions as possible with the budding software developers in colleges and universities.
Making a club where like minded software developers can meet once a month to exchange their ideas and contribute back to the society.
Familiarising IT students with latest trends and technologies in this sector so that after completing studies they have better prospects of Jobs.

## One thing that you want to plug about yourself or someone else.

I want myself to be 1% better than previous day. And I want to inculcate the same idea to others as well.
